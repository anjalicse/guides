# Sorting Algorithms

Sorting algorithms are the set of instructions which takes an array or list as a input and perform certain task to arrange its elements into a sorted order.
The order may be Ascending or Descending as per our requirement.

_`A sorting algorithm takes a list as a input and outputs a permutation of that list which is sorted.`_

### Need : 

Sorting is one of the important algorithm in Computer Science and is greatly used to reduce the complexity of a problem. These algorithms have their direct application in Searching Algorithm, Database Algorithm, Divide and Conquer Methods, Data Structures algorithm and many more.


### Some Common Sorting Algorithms :

* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
* Heap Sort
* Counting Sort
* Radix Sort
* Bucket Sort


## Classification of Sorting Algorithm :

The Sorting algorithms can be categorized on the basis of following parameters:
#### 1. Based on Number of Swaps /Inversion
The sorting algorithms can be categorised on the basis of number of times the swapping of elements has done to sort the array.  
`Selection Sort` requires minimum number of swaps.

##### 2. Based on Number of Comparisons
The sorting algorithms can be categorised on the basis of number of times the comparison of elements has done to sort the array.  
Any sorting algorithm requires atleast `O(nlogn) comparison in the best case` and `O(n^2) comparisons in the worst case` for most of the outputs.

##### 3. Based on Recursion or Non-Recursion

* Some sorting algorithm like `Quick Sort` uses recursive technique to sort the list.
* Some sorting algorithm like `Selection Sort`, `Insertion Sort` uses non-recursive technique to sort the list.
*  Some sorting algorithm like `Merge Sort` makes use of both recursive as well as Non-Recursive technique to sort the list.

##### 4. Based on Stability

Sorting algorithm are said to be `stable` if the algorithm maintains the relative order of elements with equal keys. i.e. the equivalent elements remain in same order in the sorted array as they were in the input array.
* `Insertion sort`, `Merge Sort`, `Bubble Sort` are stable in nature.
* `Heap Sort` , `Quick Sort` are not stable in nature.
