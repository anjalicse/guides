# Equation of a Line


### For a given slope and y-intercept (Standard Form):

Let 'm' be the slope of the line and 'b' be the y-intercept i.e. the point at which the given line crosses y-axis.Then,

Equation of a line is given as:
#### `y = mx+b `




### For a given slope and point through which it passes (Point-Slope Form):

Let 'm' be the slope of the line and (x1,y1) be the co-ordinate of point through which the given line passes.Then,

Equation of a line is given as:
#### `(y-y1) = m.(x-x1) `




### For given two points through which it passes:

Let (x1,y1) and (x2,y2) be the co-ordinates of two point through which the given line passes.Then,

Equation of a line is given as:
#### `(y-y1)(x2-x1) = (y2-y1).(x-x1) `
