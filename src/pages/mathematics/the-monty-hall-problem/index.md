# The Monty Hall Problem

The Monty Hall Problem is a counter-intuitive puzzle based on _Probability._ 

**The Puzzle:**


Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice to select "ONE" of the three doors. Whichever door you will select and open, you will get the prize behind that door.
 
 * Behind one door is a car and behind the others have a goat each. You are not aware of which door conceals what but the host "Monty" knows.
 
 * You will select one door and before opening that door, the host will open one of the other two doors which contains a goat.

* The host will give you a second chance to think about your choice. -" '_To Swap_' to the other unopened door." or " '_To Stick_' to the same door".

### QUESTION :
What you should choose - "_To Swap_" or "_To Stick_" to maximize your chances of winning the car?
