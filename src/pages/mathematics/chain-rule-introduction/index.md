## Chain Rule Introduction

`Chain Rule is used to compute derivative of a composition of functions.`

Let _F_ be a real valued function which is a composite of two functions _u_ and _v_  i.e F(x) = v(u(x)).
Let the derivative D{F(x)} is denoted as F'(x).

By Chain Rule, 
_### `F'(x) = u'(v(x)).v'(x)`_
