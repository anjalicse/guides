## The Slope of a Straight Line

The slope of a straight line is the measure of "steepness", usually denoted by the letter m. It is the change in y for a unit change in x along the line.

##### `m = dy/dx = tan(θ)`

where θ is the angle of inclination of line.

#### For a line passing through two points whose co-ordinate is given as (x0,y0) and (x1,y1)
The slope of straight line is given as : 

##### `m=(y1-y0)/(x1-x0)`
